## Clearbrook Reservoir B Replacement Project (2021)

**Project description:** Construction of a new reservoir for the Clearbrook Water District to replace an old one that reached end of life. This project presented some interesting challenges with 50ft vertical monolithic concrete pours and a dome shaped roof. The tank uses a post-tensioned design by DN Tanks and is expected to last 100 years.
